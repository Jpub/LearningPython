This is the "Learning Python 5th Edition" book examples package. 
Release 1.0, June 18, 2013.

----

The book example files are in the \code directory (folder);
it corresponds to "C:\code" in the book's example listings.

For unlabeled code and code run interactively in the book, 
either type manually, or cut-and-paste from an ebook copy (*).

Some examples that evolve may be given here in their final form 
only; enter earlier versions' code manually as needed or desired.

Copying is convenient, but be sure to type some code yourself 
too; it's an important part of learning a language's syntax. 

The \__admin__ directory here has various packaging tools and 
logs, borrowed from the book "Programming Python 4th Edition".
They were written initially for Python 3.X only, and may serve
as additional self-study examples.

----

(*) Ebook code hints: on Windows, using the open source "calibre"
reader on the EPUB file seems to handle whitespace well in 
cut-and-paste code.  Other combinations may work too, but Adobe 
Reader does not retain formatting for code copied from the PDF, 
and Adobe Digital Editions seems to lose line breaks (today).

Also note that some characters may have been altered by book
production: if you have trouble saving pasted code as ASCII 
text, you may need to delete and retype one or more "-" dashes.
